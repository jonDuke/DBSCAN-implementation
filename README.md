# DBSCAN-implementation
This was a personal project where I studied how exactly DBSCAN works and wrote my own implementation of it.

Simply put, DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm, the full name is Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.  These kinds of algorithms take a collection of points and assigns them into groups, and DBSCAN does this by finding dense collections of points.  These algorithms are a form of unsupervised machine learning.

My full write-up of the process can be found on my portfolio site: https://jonduke.github.io/2020-07-30-DBSCAN/

And of course the code itself is in the Jupyter notebook in this repository.
